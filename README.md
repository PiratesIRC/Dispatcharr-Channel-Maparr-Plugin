Channel Mapparr
A Dispatcharr plugin that standardizes US broadcast (OTA) and premium/cable channel names using FCC network data and curated channel lists.
Features

Dual Database Matching: Automatically identifies channels using both FCC networks.json (OTA) and channels.txt (premium/cable)
Customizable OTA Formatting: Use tags like {NETWORK}, {STATE}, {CITY}, {CALLSIGN} to format broadcast channel names
Intelligent Fuzzy Matching: Handles channel name variations, regional indicators (East/West), quality tags ([HD]/[FHD]/[SD]), and country suffixes
Logo Management: Bulk apply default logos to channels without artwork
CSV Export: Preview changes before applying with detailed dry-run reports
Group Filtering: Target specific channel groups or process all channels
Unknown Channel Tagging: Mark unmatched channels with configurable suffixes

Usage Guide
Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Configure Authentication

Enter your Dispatcharr URL, username, and password
Optionally specify Channel Groups (leave empty to process all)
Customize OTA format and unknown channel suffix
Click Save Settings

2. Load and Process Channels

Click Run on Load/Process Channels
Plugin attempts to match channels using networks.json first, then channels.txt
Review summary showing OTA vs premium/cable matches

3. Preview Changes (Dry Run)

Click Run on Preview Changes (Dry Run)
Exports CSV to /data/exports/channel_mapparr_preview_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
Review proposed changes with database source indicators

4. Apply Changes

Click Run on Rename Channels to standardize names
Rename report saved to /data/exports/channel_mapparr_renamed_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
Optionally run Add Suffix to Unknown Channels for unmatched channels

5. Apply Logos (Optional)

Configure Default Logo with display name from logo manager
Click Run on Apply Default Logos
Only applies to channels without existing logos

Channel Matching Logic
OTA Channels (networks.json)

Extracts callsigns from channel names (patterns like (KABC), WXYZ, etc.)
Looks up station data in FCC database
Formats using customizable template with network, location, and callsign
Skips channels with "WEST" or "EAST" alone (not valid callsigns)

Premium/Cable Channels (channels.txt)

Two-stage fuzzy matching process:

High-confidence match (97%+ similarity after normalization)
Number variation handling (matches "HBO 2" â†’ "HBO2")


Preserves regional indicators: (East), (West)
Preserves quality tags: [HD], [FHD], [SD], [Slow]
Preserves extra tags: (CX), (USA), etc.
Removes "USA" suffix except for "USA Network"
Ignores bracketed content and quality indicators during matching

Example Transformations
OTA Channels:
Before: ABC 7 New York WABC
After:  ABC - NY New York (WABC)
Premium/Cable Channels:
Before: HBO 2 (East) [HD]
After:  HBO2 (East) [HD]

Before: Cinemax Moviemax East [SD]
After:  MovieMax (East) [SD]

Before: 5 Star Max USA [FHD]
After:  5StarMax [FHD]

Logo Management
The plugin uses Dispatcharr's logo manager display names (not filenames):

Navigate to Logos in Dispatcharr UI
Find your desired default logo
Copy the display name (e.g., abc-logo-2013-garnet-us)
Enter in plugin's Default Logo setting
Run Apply Default Logos action


Note: Logos are only applied to channels that either have no logo or use the "Default" logo (ID 0).

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Logo not found in logo manager"

Use the logo's display name from Dispatcharr's Logos page, not the filename
Check logs for available logo names (first 30 listed)
Ensure logo has been uploaded to Dispatcharr

"No suffix configured"

If default value not working, manually enter  [Unk] (with leading space) in settings
Save settings before running actions

"No groups found"

Verify channel groups exist in Dispatcharr
Check group names are spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
Leave empty to process all groups

Channels not matching

Verify networks.json and channels.txt are in plugin directory
Check logs for callsign extraction and matching attempts
Use Preview to see which database was attempted

Debugging Commands
bash# Check plugin files
docker exec dispatcharr ls -la /data/plugins/channel_mapparr/

# Monitor plugin activity
docker logs dispatcharr | grep -i channel_mapparr

# View processing cache
docker exec dispatcharr cat /data/channel_mapparr_loaded_channels.json
